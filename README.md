# Crude Oil Price Forecasting using LSTM & GRU with Exogenous Variables

This project forecasts crude oil prices using deep learning models .
This work applies Multivariate deep learning by combined WTI crude oil prices with key macroeconomic indicators ( Dollar Index, Consumer Price Index, Industrial Production, Fed Funds Rate) and a comparative analysis of LSTM vs GRU for forecasting

# Objectives

- Forecast short-term crude oil prices accurately.
- Integrate external macroeconomic variables for better prediction.
- Evaluate model performance with visualization and metrics.
- Compare LSTM and GRU model effectiveness.
